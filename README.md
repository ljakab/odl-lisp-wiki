LISP in Open Daylight wiki
==========================

I intend to use this repository only for its version controlled [wiki](../../wiki), simply because I prefer using plain text files in command line, even for editing documents, and be able to share them via git(hub).  I may post more involved code snippets in the repository, if the need arises.
